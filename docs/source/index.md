# Welcome to Data Request's documentation!

:::{warning}
This documentation is a preliminary tech demo.

Do not mistake it for the current, official CMIP Data Request.
:::

The data request describes the data that is produced in a coordinated project of climate models,
where several modeling groups agree to perform the same numerical experiments and share the produced
results in a common format for easy inter-comparison and to facilitate further analysis and use.

## Who should read this documentation?

The data request can be useful for different audiences.

If you are a user who wants to know details about the data available for analysis, start at {ref}`analyst`.

If you are a modeler participating in a project that uses the data request to define its output, start at {ref}`modeler`.

If you are part of the definition process of the project output, start at {ref}`definer`.
